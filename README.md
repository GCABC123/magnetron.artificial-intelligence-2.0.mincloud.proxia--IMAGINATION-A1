=============================================================

This is a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for (one possible scheme in) developing an IMAGINATION PROXIA when working with ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0™ is part of MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY). The machine running the Notebook will be a MINDCLOUD on which you will be developing a PROXIA. 

USAGE:
e.g On an **ASTRAL MINDCLOUD** this **PROXIA** can be used to process **INFORMATION** sent to it from an **INSTINCTIVE MIND PROXIA/MINDCLOUD** (OBJECT DETECTION). So for example if the ROBOT encounters an intersting photograph or it sees a location from a particular angle it can take a photograph and then reconstruct the scene virtually from the photograph to better understand the layout of the environment or even what it would be like for a human to be there.


e.g **DREAMING**: IMAGINATION PROXIAS CAN BE USED BY THE ROBOTS TO "DREAM". BY DREAMING I MEAN WHEN THE ROBOT IS IN HIBERNATION/SLEEP MODE IT CAN STILL PROCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON A LIMITED BASIS. **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 **™ ROBOTS CAN EXPLORE SCENES THEY ENCOUNTERED DURING THE DAY WHILE HIBERNATING/SLEEP MODE.
