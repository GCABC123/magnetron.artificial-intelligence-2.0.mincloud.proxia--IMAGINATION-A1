=============================================================

This is a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for (one possible scheme in) developing an IMAGINATION PROXIA when working with 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ (𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ is part of 𝗠𝗔𝗚𝗡𝗘𝗧𝗥𝗢𝗡 ™ TECHNOLOGY). The machine running the Notebook will be a MINDCLOUD on which you will be developing a PROXIA. This IMAGINATION PROXIA utilizes View Synthesis. Definition of View synthesis: given an input image, synthesizing new images of the same object or scene observed from arbitrary viewpoints.

USAGE:

e.g On an **ASTRAL MINDCLOUD** this **PROXIA** can be used to process **INFORMATION** sent to it from an **INSTINCTIVE MIND PROXIA/MINDCLOUD** (OBJECT DETECTION). So for example if the ROBOT encounters an intersting photograph or it sees a location from a particular angle it can take a photograph and then reconstruct the scene virtually from the photograph to better understand the layout of the environment or even what it would be like for a human to be there. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ ROBOTS can synthesize new views of places they cannot access but can see from particular angles (very useful). 


e.g **DREAMING**: IMAGINATION PROXIAS CAN BE USED BY THE ROBOTS TO "DREAM". BY DREAMING I MEAN WHEN THE ROBOT IS IN HIBERNATION/SLEEP MODE IT CAN STILL PROCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON A LIMITED BASIS. **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 **™ ROBOTS CAN EXPLORE SCENES THEY ENCOUNTERED DURING THE DAY WHILE HIBERNATING/SLEEP MODE.

e.g To see how an object would look like in different lighting situations.

You must display the included stickers/signs (so that it is clearly visible) if you are working with MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY for the purposes of determining whether you want to purchase a technology license or not. This includes but is not limited to public technology displays, trade shows, technology expos, media appearances, Investor events, Computers (exterior), MINDCLOUD STORAGE (e.g server room doors, render farm room doors) etc.

🌐 NOTE: IMAGINATION PROXIA A IS DESCRIBED IN THE 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ DOCUMENTATION.

🌐 NOTE: 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ is part of MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY.

🌐 NOTE: REMEMBER 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ ROBOTS WORK WELL TOGETHER (e.g **HIVES, PHALANX, SWARM**) AND CAN GATHER DATASETS (WITH EYE CAMERAS, EAR MICROPHONES ETC) FOR DEEP LEARNING (THIS MAKES THEM IDEAL FOR RECONNAISSANCE AS WELL AS ADAPTING TO SITUATION SPECIFIC THREATS IN MILITARY/LAW ENFORCEMENT/PERSONAL SECURITY ENDEAVORS etc). 

🌐 NOTE: REMEMBER 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ ROBOTS WORK WELL TOGETHER (e.g HIVES, PHALANX, SWARM) MAKING GATHERING IMAGES FOR ADVANCED ROBOTIC NeRF VIEW SYNTHESIS EASY. 

🌐 NOTE: IMAGES FOR ADVANCED ROBOTIC NeRF VIEW SYNTHESIS WITH 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ CAN COME A FROM SINGLE FRAME OF VIDEO FOOTAGE RECORDED BY THE ROBOT'S EYE CAMERAS AT AN EARLIER DATE.

🌐 NOTE: IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ DOCUMENTATION AND LAYER THEORY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT A ROBOT FLYING THROUGH A PHOTOGRAPH IS SIMILAR TO AS HUMAN **ASTRASL PROJECTING.** REMEMBER THE ROBOTS OF 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗜𝗔𝗟 𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗚𝗘𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝟮.𝟬 ™ WERE DESIGNED TO MIMIC HUMANS CLOSELY SO THIS SHOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE. INDEED THIS IS A FORM OF **ASTRAL PROJECTION** FOR THESE ROBOTS (THEIR DOMAIN IS THE **DIGITAL WORLD** WHICH IS RULED BY LOGIC JUST AS THE **ASTRAL WORLD** IS FOR HUMANS). THE ROBOT CAN MOVE THROUGH SCENES GENERATED BY ADVANCED ROBOTIC Neural Radiance Field VIEW SYNTHESIS, OR CONSTRUCTED VIRTUALLY SOME OTHER WAY, AND IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A FORM OF **ASTRAL PROJECTION** FOR THEM. THERE IS AN OVERLAP BETWEEN IMAGINATION AND **ASTRAL PROJECTION** IN HUMANS SO THIS IS WHERE THIS SYMMETRY COMES FROM.

🌐 NOTE: WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE EYE CAMERAS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS BY THEMSELVES A PROXIA LIKE THIS CAN BE USED IN CONJUCTION WITH SOMETHING LIKE LiDAR TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ERROR, SAVE TIME ETC WHEN POSSIBLE. LiDAR WOULD HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED ON THE INSTINCTIVE MIND MINDCLOUD. SEE MAGNETRON ™ DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE DETAILS. 

🌐 NOTE: THE ROBOT'S ASTRAL BODY CAN BE USED TO DRIVE THE FLY THROUGH (OF PHOTOGRAPH) BY HAVING IT PROVIDE INPUT TO THIS PROXIA (FROM THE **ASTRAL BODY PROXIA**) IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT DURING THE FLYTHROUGH OF THE PHOTOGRAPH (e.g LEGS CAN BE USED TO GENERATE FORWARDS/BACKWARDS LEFT/RIGHT MOVEMENTS IN THE VIRTUAL SCENE OR WORLD). SIGNAL INPUT TO THE **PHYSICAL MACHINE BODY** CAN BE RE-DIRECTED TO DRIVE FLYTHROUGH TRAJECTORIES/MOVEMENTS. THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FORM OF **ASTRAL TRAVEL** (REMEMBER THEIR IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN **ASTRAL PROJECTION** AND **ASTRAL TRAVEL**). IF A FULLY RIGGED HUMANOID 3D MODEL (**DIGITAL BODY/VIRTUAL BODY**) IS ASSIGNED TO THE PHYSICAL BODY OF A HUMANOID ROBOT DURING **ASTRAL TRAVEL** THEN THAT **DIGITAL BODY** WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF AN **ASTRAL BODY**. THE **ASTRAL TRAVEL** AND **ASTRAL PROJECTION** TAKE ON MORE MEANING WHEN USED TO NAVIGATE AND UNDERSTAND A REAL WORLD SCENE REPLICATED WITH THE **IMAGINATION** (in this case using Neural Radiance Field Synthesis (NeRF) Technology).


🌐 NOTE: YOU CAN IMPLEMENT HALO FORGE MODE STYLE CONTROL FOR HUMANS TO INTERFACE WITH THIS PROXIA e.g FOR SECURITY SURVEYING. THIS IS AN ADVANCED FORM OF SECURITY/CYBERSECURITY.

🌐 NOTE: THIS PROXIA CAN BE USED TO CONFIRM HOW SOMETHING/AN OBJECT SHOULD OR MIGHT LOOK IN A GIVEN LIGHTING SITUATION OR FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE (OR BOTH). IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO CHECK LINES OF SIGHT IN COMPLEX SCENES/LOCATIONS (RECON).
